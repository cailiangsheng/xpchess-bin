Chinese Chess Game for X(2/3/4) Players 多人中国象棋

中国象棋通常是两个人玩的。

但如果将棋盘由2边变相为3或4边，就可以给更多人玩了。

这是本项目命名为XpChess的由来。

为了让局面得良好控制，以及棋盘的美观起见，建议X不要大于4。

赶紧玩一下吧！

有什么建议么？请发邮件告诉我：xpchess#sigma.name

Chinese chess game is usually for 2 players.

But if we change the 2-side chessboard into 3 or 4 sides, more persons can join the game.

That's why the project is called XpChess.

```X``` is supposed to be not greater than 4, for better control and good looking chessboard.

Just play it! Any suggestion? Please mail me: xpchess#sigma.name
